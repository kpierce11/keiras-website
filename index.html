    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>Hello, hi, howdy, and welcome to my first personal website. Did you know that some people don't know how to program?
       <br> It's true! <br>
        Some might not even know if the HTML and CSS they're submitting will break everything or not. 
    </p>

    <p>For instance, imagine if a new programmer were to accidentally make it where if you clicked the image above, it completely disappeared!
    That would be embarrassing. Humiliating even.<br>
    You'd probably have to add a button to fix your mistake like this one.

</p>

    <button id="showImage">Show Image</button>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    <p>They might even try to add an animated gradient for no reason at all other than to see if they can! Yes, it hurts my eyes too but it's pretty.</p>
